"""Inference engine contracts.

Every model-backed capability sits behind one of these abstract bases. Nothing
outside ``app.engines`` may import ``torch``, ``transformers``, ``faster_whisper``
or ``gtts`` directly — routes and streaming code depend only on these interfaces.

That indirection is what lets the same HTTP API run models locally during
development and call a remote host in production, without the frontend or the
route handlers changing at all.
