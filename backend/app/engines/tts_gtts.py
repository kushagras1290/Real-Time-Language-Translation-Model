"""Speech synthesis via gTTS.

gTTS needs no API key and no local model, so it stays viable on any free hosting
tier. It covers 68 of NLLB's 202 languages; the language registry declares which,
and :func:`app.languages.gtts_code` rejects the rest with a 422 before any
network call is made.

Audio is returned as bytes rather than written to a file. The original code wrote
to a fixed ``temp_speech.mp3`` path, which raced under concurrent requests and
leaked a file per call.
